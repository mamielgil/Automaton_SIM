# Automaton_SIM
Preact application that simulates Finite Automaton

# Reminders and to-dos
    1. Change mouse cursor colour depending on the active signal
        - Add node -> light green colour
        - Delete node -> red colour
        - None selected -> default cursor
    
    2. Force properties from DFA or NFA depending on what
    automaton type was selected. Specifically develop a single connection of each letter for a given node. Moreover, we need to develop NFA conditions.

    3. Figure direct and step by step for NFA

    4. When connections are drawn from A->B B->A, fix visual connection collision.
