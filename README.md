# Reminders and to-dos
    1. Change mouse cursor colour depending on the active signal
        - Add node -> light green colour
        - Delete node -> red colour
        - None selected -> default cursor
    
    2. Being able to change letter of the connection
    3. Controlling in Finite Automaton that we do not have connections with the same letter, departing from the same node.(DFA vs NFA).
