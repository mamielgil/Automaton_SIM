# Automaton_SIM
Preact application that simulates Finite Automaton

# Reminders and to-dos
    1. Change mouse cursor colour depending on the active signal
        - Add node -> light green colour
        - Delete node -> red colour
        - None selected -> default cursor
    
    2. Force properties from DFA or NFA depending on what
    automaton type was selected

    3. Figure out NDFA direct computation and step by step computation for both types.

    4. When connections are drawn from A->B B->A, fix visual connection collision.
